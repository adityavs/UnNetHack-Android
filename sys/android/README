
Build instructions


These instructions are written for a 64-bit Ubuntu installation.
Modifying them for other linux distributionos should be little to no
work. If you're running Windows you're on your own.



=== Preparations ===

 - Install the Android SDK
     http://developer.android.com/sdk

     svn checkout http://android-unnethack-port.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/\
     android-unnethack-port-read-only'

<p>NetHack History file for release 3.4</p>

<p>Behold, mortal, the origins of NetHack...</p>

<p>Jay Fenlason wrote the original Hack with help from Kenny Woodland,<br/>
Mike Thome, and Jon Payne.</p>

<p>Andries Brouwer did a major re-write, transforming Hack into a very different<br/>
game, and published (at least) three versions (1.0.1, 1.0.2, and 1.0.3) for<br/>
UNIX(tm) machines to the Usenet.</p>

<p>Don G. Kneller ported Hack 1.0.3 to Microsoft(tm) C and MS-DOS(tm), producing<br/>
PC HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics in version 1.03g, and<br/>
went on to produce at least four more versions (3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6).</p>

<p>R. Black ported PC HACK 3.51 to Lattice(tm) C and the Atari 520/1040ST,<br/>
producing ST Hack 1.03.</p>

<p>Mike Stephenson merged these various versions back together, incorporating<br/>
many of the added features, and produced NetHack version 1.4.  He then<br/>
coordinated a cast of thousands in enhancing and debugging NetHack 1.4 and<br/>
released NetHack versions 2.2 and 2.3.</p>

<p>Later, Mike coordinated a major rewrite of the game, heading a team which<br/>
included Ken Arromdee, Jean-Christophe Collet, Steve Creps, Eric Hendrickson,<br/>
Izchak Miller, Eric S. Raymond, John Rupley, Mike Threepoint, and Janet Walz,<br/>
to produce NetHack 3.0c.  The same group subsequently released ten patch-<br/>
level revisions and updates of 3.0.</p>

<p>NetHack 3.0 was ported to the Atari by Eric R. Smith, to OS/2 by Timo<br/>
Hakulinen, and to VMS by David Gentzel.  The three of them and Kevin Darcy<br/>
later joined the main development team to produce subsequent revisions of<br/>
3.0.</p>

<p>Olaf Seibert ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.  Norm Meluch, Stephen<br/>
Spackman and Pierre Martineau designed overlay code for PC NetHack 3.0.<br/>
Johnny Lee ported NetHack 3.0 to the Macintosh.  Along with various other<br/>
Dungeoneers, they continued to enhance the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga ports<br/>
through the later revisions of 3.0.</p>

<p>Headed by Mike Stephenson and coordinated by Izchak Miller and Janet Walz,<br/>
the development team which now included Ken Arromdee, David Cohrs,<br/>
Jean-Christophe Collet, Kevin Darcy, Matt Day, Timo Hakulinen, Steve Linhart,<br/>
Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Raymond, and Eric Smith undertook a radical<br/>
revision of 3.0.  They re-structured the game\'s design, and re-wrote major<br/>
parts of the code.  They added multiple dungeons, a new display, special<br/>
individual character quests, a new endgame and many other new features, and<br/>
produced NetHack 3.1.</p>

<p>Ken Lorber, Gregg Wonderly and Greg Olson, with help from Richard Addison,<br/>
Mike Passaretti, and Olaf Seibert, developed NetHack 3.1 for the Amiga.</p>

<p>Norm Meluch and Kevin Smolkowski, with help from Carl Schelin, Stephen<br/>
Spackman, Steve VanDevender, and Paul Winner, ported NetHack 3.1 to the PC.</p>

<p>Jon W{tte and Hao-yang Wang, with help from Ross Brown, Mike Engber, David<br/>
Hairston, Michael Hamel, Jonathan Handler, Johnny Lee, Tim Lennan, Rob Menke,<br/>
and Andy Swanson developed NetHack 3.1 for the Macintosh, porting it for<br/>
MPW.  Building on their development, Barton House added a Think C port.</p>

<p>Timo Hakulinen ported NetHack 3.1 to OS/2.  Eric Smith ported NetHack 3.1<br/>
to the Atari.  Pat Rankin, with help from Joshua Delahunty, is responsible<br/>
for the VMS version of NetHack 3.1.  Michael Allison ported NetHack 3.1 to<br/>
Windows NT.</p>

<p>Dean Luick, with help from David Cohrs, developed NetHack 3.1 for X11.<br/>
Warwick Allison wrote a tiled version of NetHack for the Atari;<br/>
he later contributed the tiles to the DevTeam and tile support was<br/>
then added to other platforms.</p>

<p>The 3.2 development team, comprised of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee, David<br/>
Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen, Steve<br/>
Linhart, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith, Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and<br/>
Paul Winner, released version 3.2 in April of 1996.</p>

<p>Version 3.2 marked the tenth anniversary of the formation of the development<br/>
team.  In a testament to their dedication to the game, all thirteen members<br/>
of the original development team remained on the team at the start of work<br/>
on that release.  During the interval between the release of 3.1.3 and 3.2,<br/>
one of the founding members of the development team, Dr. Izchak Miller,<br/>
passed away.  That release of the game was dedicated to him by the<br/>
development and porting teams.</p>

<p>Version 3.2 proved to be more stable than previous versions.  Many bugs<br/>
were fixed, abuses eliminated, and game features tuned for better game<br/>
play.</p>

<p>During the lifespan of NetHack 3.1 and 3.2, several enthusiasts of the game<br/>
added their own modifications to the game and made these "variants" publicly<br/>
available:</p>

<p>Tom Proudfoot and Yuval Oren created NetHack++, which was quickly renamed<br/>
NetHack--.  Working independently, Stephen White wrote NetHack Plus.<br/>
Tom Proudfoot later merged NetHack Plus and his own NetHack-- to produce<br/>
SLASH.  Larry Stewart-Zerba and Warwick Allison improved the spellcasting<br/>
system with the Wizard Patch.  Warwick Allison also ported NetHack to use<br/>
the Qt interface.</p>

<p>Warren Cheung combined SLASH with the Wizard Patch to produce Slash\'em, and<br/>
with the help of Kevin Hugo, added more features.  Kevin later joined the<br/>
DevTeam and incorporated the best of these ideas in NetHack 3.3.</p>

<p>The final update to 3.2 was the bug fix release 3.2.3, which was released<br/>
simultaneously with 3.3.0 in December 1999 just in time for the Year 2000.</p>

<p>The 3.3 development team, consisting of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee, <br/>
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Steve Creps, Kevin Darcy, Timo Hakulinen, <br/>
Kevin Hugo, Steve Linhart, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin, Eric Smith, <br/>
Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, released 3.3.0 in <br/>
December 1999 and 3.3.1 in August of 2000.</p>

<p>Version 3.3 offered many firsts. It was the first version to separate race<br/> 
and profession. The Elf class was removed in preference to an elf race,<br/> 
and the races of dwarves, gnomes, and orcs made their first appearance in <br/>
the game alongside the familiar human race.  Monk and Ranger roles joined <br/>
Archeologists, Barbarians, Cavemen, Healers, Knights, Priests, Rogues, <br/>
Samurai, Tourists, Valkyries and of course, Wizards.  It was also the first<br/>
version to allow you to ride a steed, and was the first version to have a<br/>
publicly available web-site listing all the bugs that had been discovered.<br/>
Despite that constantly growing bug list, 3.3 proved stable enough to last<br/>
for more than a year and a half.</p>

<p>The 3.4 development team initially consisted of Michael Allison, Ken Arromdee,<br/>
David Cohrs, Jessie Collet, Kevin Hugo, Ken Lorber, Dean Luick, Pat Rankin,<br/>
Mike Stephenson, Janet Walz, and Paul Winner, with Warwick Allison joining<br/>
just before the release of NetHack 3.4.0 in March 2002.</p>

<p>As with version 3.3, various people contributed to the game as a whole as<br/>
well as supporting ports on the different platforms that NetHack runs on:</p>

<p>Pat Rankin maintained 3.4 for VMS.</p>

<p>Michael Allison maintained NetHack 3.4 for the MS-DOS platform.  <br/>
Paul Winner and Yitzhak Sapir provided encouragement.</p>

<p>Dean Luick, Mark Modrall, and Kevin Hugo maintained and enhanced the<br/>
Macintosh port of 3.4.</p>

<p>Michael Allison, David Cohrs, Alex Kompel, Dion Nicolaas, and Yitzhak Sapir<br/> 
maintained and enhanced 3.4 for the Microsoft Windows platform. Alex Kompel <br/>
contributed a new graphical interface for the Windows port. Alex Kompel also<br/>
contributed a Windows CE port for 3.4.1.</p>

<p>Ron Van Iwaarden maintained 3.4 for OS/2.</p>

<p>Janne Salmijarvi and Teemu Suikki maintained and enhanced the<br/> 
Amiga port of 3.4 after Janne Salmijarvi resurrected it for 3.3.1.</p>

<p>Christian `Marvin\' Bressler maintained 3.4 for the Atari after he<br/>
resurrected it for 3.3.1.</p>

<p>There is a NetHack web site maintained by Ken Lorber at http://www.nethack.org</p>

<p>From time to time, some depraved individual out there in netland sends a<br/>
particularly intriguing modification to help out with the game.  The Gods of<br/>
the Dungeon sometimes make note of the names of the worst of these miscreants<br/>
in this, the list of Dungeoneers:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NetHack GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson)<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Based on the BISON general public license,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this<br/>
&nbsp;license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also use this wording to<br/>
&nbsp;make the terms for other programs.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of<br/>
those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is intended to give<br/>
everyone the right to share NetHack.  To make sure that you get the rights we<br/>
want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you<br/>
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  Hence this license<br/>
agreement.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away<br/>
copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you<br/>
want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free<br/>
programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to<br/>
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute copies<br/>
of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You<br/>
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you<br/>
must tell them their rights.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out<br/>
that there is no warranty for NetHack.  If NetHack is modified by someone<br/>
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is<br/>
not what we distributed.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make<br/>
the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or<br/>
change NetHack.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COPYING POLICIES<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as<br/>
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on<br/>
all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the<br/>
absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack<br/>
program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and<br/>
copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above<br/>
(including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you also do the<br/>
following:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;changed the files and the date of any change; and<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third parties, at your option)<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in exchange for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it,<br/>
under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br/>
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site.  (This<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)<br/>
<br/>

<h1>The UnNetHack Android Port Manual</h1>

<p><small>This manual is displayed automatically once. If you need it later it can be found in the settings. Press back to close this screen.</small></p>

<br/>
<h3>The basics</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply tap the screen to move one step in the desired direction.
Long-press to move until you run into something.
 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tap the character to interact with what\'s on the floor. Move up/down stairs, pick up objects, loot chests, etc.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan and zoom works in the usual way with the drag and pinch gestures. If your phone is equipped with a d-pad
or trackball you can pan by pressing a direction key or rotating the trackball, while holding down
the center button. You can also zoom with the volume buttons.
</p>
	 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan the map and tap on a position to Travel to it (see the
<font color="lime"><em>_</em></font> command in the UnNetHack
help). This can be disabled with the <font color="aqua"><em>Travel after pan</em></font> option. <br/>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-press an inventory item to specify an amount, when for instance dropping (<font color="lime"><em>d</em></font>) something.</p>

<br/>
<h3>The command panel</h3> 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The command panel is the scrollable row of buttons at the bottom of the screen.
When you click a button the game will do whatever is written on it, as though you typed
each character one after another: 
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="lime"><em>i</em></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view inventory<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="lime"><em>20s</em></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;search 20 times
</p>
		  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequence <font color="lime"><em>...</em></font> is treated as a special command to open the soft
keyboard.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-press on any button to change it, remove it, or add a new one to the left of it.
</p>
	 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Control commands are entered with <font color="lime"><em>^</em></font> followed by a letter:</p>
	  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="lime"><em>^D</em></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kick<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="lime"><em>^T</em></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teleport
</p>
	    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Meta commands are entered with <font color="lime"><em>M-</em></font> followed by a letter:</p>
	
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="lime"><em>M-j</em></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jump<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="lime"><em>M-2</em></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two-weapon
</p>
	    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don\'t want to see the panel you can hide it in the settings.</p>


<br/>
<h3>The soft keyboard</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Press <font color="lime"><em>...</em></font> to open the soft keyboard. Press back to close it again.
When the soft keyboard is opened you can play UnNetHack almost as you would on a regular terminal.
If you prefer to play with the keyboard you might want to turn the <font color="aqua"><em>Automenu</em></font> option off.
</p>

<br/>
<h3>The volume keys</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume keys can be mapped to a number of different actions. <font color="aqua"><em>Zoom in</em></font>, <font color="aqua"><em>Zoom out</em></font>, <font color="aqua"><em>Toggle keyboard</em></font>,
 <font color="aqua"><em>Ctrl</em></font>, and <font color="aqua"><em>Meta</em></font>.
</p>
 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Press <font color="aqua"><em>Toggle keyboard</em></font> to open or close the soft keyboard.
Keep holding the volume key when you open the keyboard to close it again when you release the key.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Use <font color="aqua"><em>Ctrl</em></font> and <font color="aqua"><em>Meta</em></font> to send control and meta commands with a physical keyboard.
The soft keyboard will be opened if your phone doesn\'t have a physical one.   
</p>
